# TaskPlanner

Task Planner is an application designed to help you organize your daily tasks efficiently. It allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks, and filter them by status: completed, pending, or all. Additional features include the ability to clear completed tasks and a task counter displaying the total number of tasks. All tasks are automatically saved in LocalStorage, ensuring that no data is lost. The application features a user-friendly, intuitive interface and is currently deployed using Firebase Hosting.
